# Simulation of the butterworth filter

## How to run simulation

1. Run the first section of the matlab script "filter_testing.m" to generate the input signal. This will generate the input_signal.txt file 
2. Run the "tb_butterworth_filter_cascade.vhd" testbench on vivado. This will generate the "output_signal.txt"
3. Run the rest of the "filter_testing.m" script to plot the input and output signals in time and frequency
